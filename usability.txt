Each project usability can be divided into these sections:
- 0: Completely unusable
- 1: Barely usable. May have severe bugs, or might not work out of the box.
- 2: Somewhat usable. May work out of the box, but has some issues.
- 3: Very usable. Works well, but you may stumble upon some issues.
- 4: "Production-ready".
