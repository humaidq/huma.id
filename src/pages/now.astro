    I have been working at <a href="https://tii.ae"
      >Technology Innovation Institute</a
    > since August of 2021, where I'm currently involved on the development of the
    <a href="https://github.com/tiiuae/ghaf">Ghaf Framework</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I also spend my personal time learning more about technology, computer
    science, and more recently radio. You might find me operating FT8 on the
    amateur radio bands.
