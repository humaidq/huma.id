This is a list of software which improved the way I use my computer.

**Backing up**

> I use [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/) which allows me to efficiently
> backup my files, it supports encryption and deduplication of files, allowing
> me to use a fraction of space compared to a traditional method.

**Text editing & document processing**

> I use [neovim](https://neovim.io/) because it is fast, minimal and just works.
> Editors like VS Code and Atom sucks, a text editor shouldn't be using
> 500-700MB of RAM to open a small text file.

> I usually write my notes and reports in Markdown, which is then converted to
> PDF (through LaTeX) with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
> is used when I need more control over the document.

**Linux/Unix utilities and programs**

- [maim](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim): a simple command-line based screenshot program.
- [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)/[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/): my favourite shell environment setup.
- [sxiv](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv): a perfect, minimal image viewer.
- [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/): a light PDF viewer which uses Vi keyboard shortcuts.
- [Claws Mail](https://www.claws-mail.org/): a mail client which is lightweight and delightful to use.

**Desktop environment**

- My window manager is dwm, modified to support volume, brightness, display and
  pomodoro (`spt`) support, and theme colour changed. I like the way dwm
  arranges windows (compared to i3wm).
- My terminal emulator is st, which seems to just work well.
