<Recipe defaultServing={4} client:load />

### Ingredients

- <RecipeUnit met={[30, "g"]} us={[1, "oz"]} client:idle /> Yerba Mate
- <RecipeUnit met={[1, "L"]} us={[1, "qt"]} client:idle /> Hot water
- <RecipeUnit met={[2, "g"]} us={[0.5, "tsp"]} client:idle /> Citric Acid
- Sugar-free sweetner, whatever equivalent to <RecipeUnit met={[3.5, "tbsp"]} us={[3.5, "tbsp"]} client:idle /> of sugar.
  - I used <RecipeUnit met={[1, "tbsp"]} us={[1, "tbsp"]} client:idle /> Steviana brand sweetner, which had acesulfame and sorbitol in addition to stevia, which negated the bitterness and aftertaste of pure stevia.

### Preparation

- Prepare <RecipeUnit met={[1,"L"]} us={[1, "qt"]} client:idle /> hot water at <RecipeTemp temp={80} client:idle/> (not higher, as not to burn the yerba).
- Let the yerba mate leaves steep in the <RecipeTemp temp={80} client:idle/> hot water for 10 minutes.
- Strain away the mate leaves, and mix in the citric acid and sweetner.
- Let it cool.

This is the mate base, dilute 1:1 with sparkling water. Or use regular water and carbonate using a soda machine.
