### Are the pictures downloaded from the web?

No, I have took all of the pictures and released them under a
creative commons license.

### Which camera do you use?

I use my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 to take all of the photos.

### Why don't you use something like Instagram or Flickr?

These services do not fit my need, Instagram by Facebook is a
social media platform which compresses images to a lower quality 
and doesn't provide an option to download them. While Flickr
started deleting pictures of non-paying users, requiring them
to pay an expensive subscription[^1].

It makes more sense to self-host my gallery than to rely on a
service that can shut down my account or delete my images at any point.

### Why are faces blurred?

According to UAE laws, you need consent before taking a picture of someone. So
all pictures of faces are blurred.

If you have a problem in any of the photos in my gallery, contact me
via my email: me @ this domain and I'll do my best to resolve the issue.
