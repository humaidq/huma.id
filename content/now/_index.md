*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), which is where I write a
summary of what I am doing right now.*

**Last updated:** 15th May 2022, from Ajman, United Arab Emirates.

I got married and have graduated with Bachelor of Computer Science with Honours
of the first class during summer of 2021.

On August 2021, I started working at the [Technology Innovation
Institute](https://tii.ae), where I build and test secure drones.

Recently, I have been waking up early in the morning to work on my
side-projects, which is the only way I can get my work done since
starting a full-time job.
