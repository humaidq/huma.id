**Last updated:** 17th September 2021, from Ajman, United Arab Emirates.

I graduated with Bachelor of Computer Science with Honours of the First Class
this summer. As of August 2021, I started my job as a Senior Associate Software
Engineer at the [Technology Innovation Insitute](https://tii.ae) in Abu Dhabi.
