*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), which is where I write a
summary of what I am doing right now.*

I'm currently a Computer Science student at Heriot-Watt University, doing my
final year of my undergraduate study. I'm currently working on my dissertation
project, which is a web application that allows users to build their own Linux
distribution.

I also try to manage my time and work on my [existing open-source
projects](/projects/).
