*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), which is where I write a
summary of what I am doing right now.*

**Last updated:** 30th August 2020

I'm currently a Computer Science student at Heriot-Watt University, preparing
to start the last year of my undergraduate study. I have been working on the
[Platform](/projects/platform/) project recently with
[Alakbar](https://alak.bar).

I also try to manage my time and work on my [existing open-source
projects](/).
