description: What I am doing right now...

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), which is where I write a
summary of what I am doing right now.*

**Last updated:** 19th December 2022, from Ajman, United Arab Emirates.

I am currently preparing for military conscription (national service), where I
will serve starting from February 2023.

I got married and have graduated with Bachelor of Computer Science with Honours
of the first class during summer of 2021.

Since then, I have been working at the [Technology Innovation Institute](https://tii.ae), where I
build and test secure systems.
