title: What I'm Doing Now
---

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), which is where I write a
summary of what I am doing right now.*

**Last updated:** 15th May 2020

I'm currently a Computer Science student at Heriot-Watt University, stuck at
home working on internships, enjoying my last summer break of my undergraduate
study. All the work done during my current internships will be released under
an open-source license, more details coming soon.

I also try to manage my time and work on my existing open-source projects.
