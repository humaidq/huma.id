title: What I'm Doing Now
description: What I am doing right now...

*This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about), which is where I write a
summary of what I am doing right now.*

**Last updated:** 3rd February 2022, from Ajman, United Arab Emirates.

I got married and have graduated with Bachelor of Computer Science with Honours
of the first class during summer of 2021.

I currently work at [TII](https://tii.ae), where I build and test [secure
drones](https://youtu.be/7UBccWJThqk). But in my free time, I try to work on my
side projects -- including the recipes section on this website!

My current top goals are improving my skill set (regarding Linux, programming,
and computer security) and optimising my time management to get more things
done.
