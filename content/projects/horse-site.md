---

This is a web application for equestrian clubs to manage their daily schedule of trainers and riders. It
allows the club to keep track of the horses and riders, generate reports and print formatted schedules.
This project is written by me and my peers from university as a part of a small web development team.  

The goal of this application is to make it easier for clubs to manage schedules using a modern web-based
solution, which is fast and reliable, and can run on any browser. Our focus is on making the app easy-to-use
and platform-independent but remain still as powerful as traditional schedule management software.
