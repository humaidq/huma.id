Usability: 4

This is an archive repository to my three old Sponge plugins, which I am sure no longer works in the current version of Sponge server.

This repository includes;  

- PlayerLogger: A simple Sponge plugin which logs player events. 
- ChatLimiter: A simple Sponge plugin which allows you to limit the rate of chat messages and commands.
- SignColours: A simple plugin that colours signs with permissions.

All of which are released under the MIT license. The code was last updated in 2015.
