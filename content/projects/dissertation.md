### Overview

This is a project that I have created as my dissertation for my BSc Computer
Science (honours) degree at Heriot-Watt University.

This project aims to provide a web application which allows you to build your
own custom operating system (Linux distribution) with security settings which
matches your requirements, abstracting complicated Linux configurations to a
simple wizard which adapts to user's knowledge level. The final result is an
installable system disc/image, which may be placed on a USB flash drive to
install systems or used without an install (live mode).

This allows anyone, including individuals, organisations, or enthusiasts to
create an operating system that matches their use case and security
requirements, without being security experts. Security experts are also able to
use the tool to build a safer operating system.
