### 1. Description
![Screenshot of the analysis page showing statistics of the trace file and
a table of connections with buttons to view jitter](../screenshots/ns2-analysis.png)

This web application allows you to analyse [trace files](http://nile.wpi.edu/NS/analysis.html)
generated by [ns2](https://www.isi.edu/nsnam/ns/) (Network Simulator 2). It
will generate the following:

- Jitter graphs for all segments of the network
- Number of:
  - Received packets
  - Dropped packets
  - Lost packets.
  - Collisions in the network
  - Average hops
  - Total active nodes
  - Trace file entries (which are `tcp`, `udp`, or `cbr`)
- Average delay
- Total bandwidth used
- Total network time
- Network throughput

### 2. Requirements

The following packages must be installed on your system.

- Go
- Git

You also need to have a trace file so use on the web application.

### 3. Copying and contributing

This program is written by Humaid AlQassimi, and is distributed under the
AGPL 3.0 only license. This means if you make your
own version of this tool, you must release its source under the same license.

### 4. Downloading and building

```sh
$ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~humaid/ns2-trace-go
$ cd ns2-trace-go
$ go build *.go
```

### 5. Usage
You can optionally set the port, by setting the `PORT` environment variable.
```sh
$ ns2-trace-go
```
By default, it will use port `:4000`.
