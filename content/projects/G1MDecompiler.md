Description: "A simple Casio Basic decoder for '.g1m' files generated by Casio calculators."
Usability: 3

### 1. Purpose
The goal of G1M Decompiler is to allow programmers to decode Casio Basic's "`.g1m`"
file into a readable text similarly what is shown on the calculator. I have
created this because the only available program to read G1M (Casio Basic) files
does not run on Linux, and there is no way to read the files.  

This is a one-way converter, and not all symbols are supported by this program (most
common symbols are).  

### 2. Requirements

The following packages must be installed on your system

- Go
- Git

You also need a Casio Basic file to decode.

### 3. Copying and contributing

This program is written by Humaid AlQassimi, and is distributed under
the MIT license.  

### 4. Download and install

```sh
$ go get -u git.sr.ht/~humaid/g1mdecompiler
$ go install git.sr.ht/~humaid/g1mdecompiler
```

### 5. Usage
The program outputs the decoded program to standard output.
```sh
$ g1mdecompiler [file] > [output]
```
