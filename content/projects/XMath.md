----------

XMath is a tiny learning management system application for Android, it helps
teachers and tutors to setup mathematical questions. The questions can be setup
and solved on the same device, or can be setup over Bluetooth so that the
instructor could beam the questions to students devices. And then students can
send back the answers to the instructor's device.

The application has two accounts, a student's account and an instructor's
account. The instructor is able to set up the quiz and review the answers
Student are able to solve the quiz if it is set up. And the instructor has
options to host a Bluetooth server for devices setup on Bluetooth mode.

instructor is required to set up a new quiz each time a quiz is finished, or
receive the quiz over Bluetooth if it is setup on Bluetooth mode.
