### 1. Description

This is a simple mod player manager, which uses FFplay in the backend. It simply
shuffles the mod music files in the directory and plays them.

It allows you to easily pause and resume the music with convenient key-bindings.

### 2. Prerequisites

You will need `ffmpeg` installed and the `ffplay` binary in the system's path.

And of course, you will need music files. You can find many on [Mod
Archive](https://modarchive.org).

### 3. Usage

Clone the repository, and place music files in the directory.
Simply run the script with `./player`. Press `h` on your keyboard to list all
available commands.
