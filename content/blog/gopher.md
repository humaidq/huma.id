A Gopher version of my website is available! You can access it by visiting
<gopher://humaidq.ae> with a browser that supports it, such as [lynx]. Or 
alternatively, view the site with [Floodgap](https://gopher.floodgap.com/gopher/gw?humaidq.ae)
on a modern browser. This is how it looks with lynx:

HTTPS website, loaded on the lynx browser](gopher.png)

In the future, I may extend it to be a closer copy of my current website, and
to include the blog, projects, among other things.
