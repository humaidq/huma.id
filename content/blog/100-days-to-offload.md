In the past couple of months, many bloggers started to take part in the
[`#100DaysToOffload` challenge](https://100daystooffload.com/) which is
started by [Kev Quirk]. The goal is to allow bloggers to jump-start their
personal blogs by posting once per day for 100 days. Kev later [changed the
goal of the challenge](https://kevq.uk/100-days-to-offload-over-saturation/) to
publishing 100 posts in a year, as that gives time to draft and refine the
posts before publishing.

[Horst](https://zerokspot.com/) called the challenge in his blog post:
"[100DaysToOffload now more like
100PostsToOffload](https://zerokspot.com/weblog/2020/05/13/new-100daystooffload-rules/)",
hence the name of this post. I'll try my best to publish a new post about every
3.5 days, while hopefully writing somewhat interesting content.

Today, I finally decided to clean up the website's source and publish it as
open-source. This would make it easier for friends to see how the website is
built.

*This is my first post in the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
challenge.*
