When sending emails in the mailing list, make sure that;


- your emails are plain text, HTML emails are rejected by the server
- when you reply, cut parts which you are not directly responding to
- the lines in your email does not exceed 72 characters
- if you use PGP, attach your PGP signature instead of including it inline



_This is a tl;dr of the mailing list ettiquette found [here](https://man.sr.ht/lists.sr.ht/etiquette.md)._
