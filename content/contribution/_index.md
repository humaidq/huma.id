To contribute to any of my projects, be sure to familiarise yourself
with [git](https://git-scm.com/) as this is what the projects use
for [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).  

Once you are familiar with git and have commited your changes. Make
sure git is setup to send patches by email, check out this tutorial
for an interactive guide on setting up email with git!  

<https://git-send-email.io/>

Make sure to send the patch to the appropriate mailing list, as
listed on the project's page. **Note:** Sending patches using your
email client or other means than `git send-email` will break your
patches, making it difficult to apply!  

Contribution is highly appreciated!
