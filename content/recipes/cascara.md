This is one of the most refreshing drinks I have ever tried. It is made
essentially from the fruit of the coffee (as the coffee beans are just a seed),
which is called cascara (which is "husk" in Spanish).

Cascara is sold as a dried fruit, which you may find sold at some of your local
speciality coffee roaster. Although if you live in the UK or the EU, you might have
difficulty finding it due to laws and regulations. In the UAE, you can find
cascara sold by [Cypher Roastery](https://bycypher.com).
