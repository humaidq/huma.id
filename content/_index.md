Welcome to my personal website. You can find my open-source projects, blog,
gallery, and other works on this website.

I like writing minimalist software which solves problems. Most of my projects
are written in [Go](https://golang.org), and I am always trying to learn new
things.

## My top projects

Here are some projects I am proud of.

- [Neat Note](/projects/neatnote): a website for students to share resources,
  notes, and start discussions. With [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs)-like voting
  system on posts.
- [Learning Bot](/projects/learning-bot/): a GitLab bot for providing
    programming advice for university students.
- [godoc2markdown](/projects/godoc2markdown/): a program which converts Go Doc
	output to Markdown.
